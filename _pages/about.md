Welcome to my blog where I post things I learn on my journey to becoming a Cyber Security professional!

My name is Adam and I am a Cyber Security student at the University of Warwick. I am currently in my third year of University and I am a part of the Cyber Security Society at Warwick. Within cyber, my main interests are:
- Network Security
- Web Security
- Malware Analysis
- Reverse Engineering

Here on this blog I will be posting about techniques and skills I learn. I will also be posting tutorials on challenges for CTF and HTB challenges which I come across when competing. The main focus of this blog is to help others learn and grow in the Cyber Security field as well as it being a resource I can refer back to in the future. Challenges where I apply my skills will mostly be from:
- HackTheBox
- TryHackMe
- VulnHub
- CTFs
- ROPEmporium
- OverTheWire
- Exploit.education

and many more sites and resources I come across.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
